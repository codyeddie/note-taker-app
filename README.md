## Installation 
To install this application you must first clone the repo to your local machine. Once the repo is cloned to your machine, you must run the 'npm install' and 'npm install express' commands to get your node packages going. Once those are installed you will have to run the command 'node server' in your command line to start at the application. From there, you will navigate to http://localhost:3001 to use the application.
